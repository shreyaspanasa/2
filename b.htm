<p>I feel excited while doing projects from school i have been given many projects but rarely on computers so I am at present feeling pretty excited as this the first time I am creating my oen website in this process I am learning Html and CSS. It was intresting doing this project but it took a lot of time in learning the basics of html and css but now  I am able to create my own webpage .At the middle I used to get stuck then again I used to read and solve it out.It is pretty much intrestig getting to do projects as it opens up our creative mind and we get to know many things which we did not know earlier.</p>
